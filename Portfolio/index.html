                <h1>Why programming?</h1>
                <strong><small>Great question.</small></strong>

                <p>I developed an interest in coding/programming during my senior year at Rutgers. I took a web development course to earn enough credits to graduate. At the time, I despised coding
                    because Rutgers required every IT and CS major to learn object oriented programming ONLY through Java. These courses were difficult to follow and I quickly grew tired of them. At first,
                    I was reluctant to take this web dev course, but as I went through the course I realized that programming isn't all that terrible and was actually a bit of fun. When I graduated, I took a self-study
                    web dev course where I created a couple of fake websites for projects. Unfortunately, the job I was hired for did not involve or utilize the skills I learned through the courses I took, and I quickly
                    forgot the material I had worked so hard to learn. Fast forward a year, I am working the graveyard shift monitoring data centers across the globe. I had a lot of downtime in this position, and I thought about
                    using the time I had to be productive. I began relearning how to program through Codecademy, and I realized how much I had actually come to enjoy programming. I realized that programming can actually be quite fun
                    and rewarding. As someone who enjoys learning and creating new things, I hope to develop and hone my skills to become a software developer or engineer one day.
